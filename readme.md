# Visualization of Linear Transformations 

## Motivation


## Controls 
- R: resets the animation
- Space: pauses the animation
- Numbers 1 to 5 switch between matrices


## Matrices involved 
- 1: Rotation matrix 
- 2: Shear matrix 
- 3: Squeeze matrix 
- 4: Stretch matrix 
- 5: Rotation + Shear matrix
